                    <h2>Delhi recordes 2nd cleansed air post-Diwali since 2015.Here's te reason</h2>
                    <p>Delhi's air quality has been the second cleanest post-Diwali since 2015, maintaining a “very poor” Air Quality Index (AQI) instead of deteriorating to “severe". This stability is credited to “strong wind ventilation", with speeds reaching 16 kilometres per hour.While the 24-hour air quality index (AQI) climbed steadily through Thursday night — from 328 in the early evening to 338 at midnight, reaching 362 by 9am Friday — the city experienced an unexpected respite. Strong, sustained winds swept through Delhi, rapidly dispersing the dense smoke layer and bringing the AQI down to 339 by 4pm Friday, further improving to 323 by 7pm.Mahesh Palawat, vice president at Skymet meteorology, explained this complex interaction between temperature and pollution: “Higher temperature keeps mixing height high and allows pollutants to move and disperse freely. Low temperature slows down wind speed and also traps pollutants closer to the surface through a phenomena called inversion.”</p>
                    <p>He noted that while winter months typically see the mixing height drop to a mere 200-300 metres, Thursday maintained mixing height of 2,100 metres.“Even though the air quality on Diwali was in the very poor category — hitting severe levels during midnight — these conditions dissipated quickly the next day to reach moderate levels by the afternoon. This is mainly because of relatively warm conditions with reasonable wind speed and natural ventilation. The deep calm winter inversion conditions are yet to set in. Despite this, the month of October has also seen more poor and very poor days than previous years, even when the contribution of farm fires has been just around 1-3%, indicating a very high impact of local and regional pollution,” Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Research and Advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) told The Times of India.</p>

                    <h3>Bengaluru man claims attack by goons on crowded street, police respond to viral video</h3>
                    <p>Two days after a family travelling by a car was attacked by goons in Bengaluru’s Kasavanahalli, another video of a group of miscreants attacking a man and his car near the Kudlu area emerged on social media. Deven Mehta was attacked by the goons on a crowded street at around 7 PM.</p>
                    <p>Sharing videos of the incident, Mehta shared that he had a woman in his car, however, the goons kept attacking while a traffic cop watched the scene. He shared that the goon allegedly broke the window glass, threw stones, and threatened him. The now-viral video shows a traffic cop trying to stop the altercation.“My car was attacked by goons on crowded bangalore streets at 7pm while a traffic police watched them break glasses, throw stones & threaten us at Kudlu, despite a woman in the car,” Mehta wrote on X.</p>

                    <h3>Crude imports fall amid refinery shutdowns and West Asia tension</h3>
                    <p>India’s crude oil imports in October declined to a 13-month low amid maintenance-related shutdowns at some refineries and the geopolitical crisis in West Asia which led to fears of high volatility in international oil prices. Consequently, import volumes from the top five suppliers — Russia, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States — declined sequentially, according to ship tracking data.</p>
                    <p>In October, Indian refiners cumulatively imported 4.35 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, down 7.6 per cent month-on-month, according to provisional vessel tracking data from international commodity market analytics firm Kpler. Going forward, industry watchers expect oil imports to rebound in November as all Indian refiners would be fully back on stream amid robust demand and expectations of relatively limited oil price volatility in the international market.</p>

                        <p>Ajaz Patel picks his sixth wicket and India gets whitewashed in the home series for the first time since 2000. It has been an extremely poor chase from them. Apart from Rishabh Pant not even a single batter looked like they had their approach right or method fixed to play on these conditions. This loss is not just a dent in WTC points but also a black mark on Rohit Sharma the captain. November doesn't seem to be the month for Rohit as captain. Congratulations to the New Zealand side it will be one of the greatest Test victories from their perspective.Ajaz picked up 11 wickets in the match and was the destruction in-chief for New Zealand meanwhile, Will Young scored two half-centuries in both innings and was the spine of the Kiwi batting order.</p>
